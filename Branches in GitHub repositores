Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named 'main' which is considered to be the definitive branch, and applications/servers are deployed from the main branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

When you create a branch off the main branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of 'main' as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

In GitHub, developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from the main (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into main.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself.
