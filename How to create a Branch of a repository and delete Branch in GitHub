Go to your new repository Git_Info.

Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: main.

Type a branch name into the new branch text box.

Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

To delete a branch, go to the main page of your repository, click the Branch tab with the branch icon, and then click the rubbish bin icon adjacent to the branch you want to delete.

You can restore braches if it hadn't been a long time since deletion.
